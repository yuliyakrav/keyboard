# Magniboard


Magniboard is our text input technique designed for small devices such as a smartwatch. It is specifically designed to reduce the fat-finger problem presented in many small touchscreen devices.

To test Magniboard, you will be presented with 45 phrases to transcribe. Once all phrases are transcribed, your test results will be downloaded to your computer as an .xml file.


# How to use Magniboard

Using Magniboard is very simple. As soon as a user touches the keyboard, a enlarged tooltip appears above their finger displaying which character they are currently on, and what characters are surrounding it. The user is able to adjust their finger accordingly to their desired character while the tooltip adjusts to their position. To select and input the character, the user simply lifts their finger off the screen when they reach their desired character. 

To increase efficiency, we also designed specific techniques for common actions like backspace or to capitalize characters. Swiping left to delete a character and swiping up or down to capitalize and lowercase the keyboard.
